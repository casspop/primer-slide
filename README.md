## Hornady Lock N Load primer slide replacement

Typically the primer slide has little to no stress on it.  So it's rare for it to break.

When I added the PrimerCop to my press, the first version of the lower mount had a section that rubbed against the wheel on the primer slide as it went by to its lowest position during seating.

It worked fine like that, but a friend of mine was seating his second primer, and was a little too aggressive with the handle as he pressed it forward.  The wheel caught the lower IR break-beam mount instead of rubbing.  The result was a broken slide.

The replacement was about $35.00 with shipping, so I decided I needed to see if I could make one myself.

This part is printed at a 0.1mm layer height with no infill using PLA.  It works perfectly.

I was able to salvage and use the shaft and wheel from the broken slide.

The 3D printed holes were all very close, and a drill bit finished them out perfectly.

I used a 1/4" endmill in my drill press to mill out the groove in the top.
